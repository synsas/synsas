1. Adding text to this file to see if a second commit and push will generate a hook send
- This didn't work as expected.
2. Trying again.
- this posted successfully to the post bin url, but didn't automatically open index.html.  So I changed it to get the json...I think and named it index.php.
I'll run it immediately from the console..not sure this is going to work.  I might have to read about hooks in git some more.
- Didn't work as expected again.
3.  Changed url online to explicitly call index.php
- nope
4. changed script
5. added no data msg
6. testing the writing of a local precommit hook that could be used to run unit tests
7.  2nd hook test - chmod a+x and added unix line to i9ndicate where to find php
8. 3rd test - removed .php from hook name
9. pre-commit hook test was successful - now testing push to central repository
10. installed pear; installed pear VersionControl - git - only to find I'm not sure how to execute a simple command.  Looked up php and found a simple exec-shell command and trying that
11.  Realized I need to put the php in the post-commit file since I want to push to the repository after I commit to the local repository
12. Had to change permissions on post-commit to add execute
13. Testing github post receive hook.  var/www/ci/git-scripts/github_post_receive.php
14. Tried to download a mail server software and got the html page called, but no emial.  Now I'm testing the post-receive to see if there's any JSON
