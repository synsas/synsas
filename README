1. Adding text to this file to see if a second commit and push will generate a hook send
- This didn't work as expected.
2. Trying again.
- this posted successfully to the post bin url, but didn't automatically open index.html.  So I changed it to get the json...I think and named it index.php.
I'll run it immediately from the console..not sure this is going to work.  I might have to read about hooks in git some more.
- Didn't work as expected again.
3.  Changed url online to explicitly call index.php
- nope
4. changed script
5. added no data msg
6. testing the writing of a local precommit hook that could be used to run unit tests
7.  2nd hook test - chmod a+x and added unix line to i9ndicate where to find php
8. 3rd test - removed .php from hook name
