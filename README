1. Adding text to this file to see if a second commit and push will generate a hook send
- This didn't work as expected.
2. Trying again.
- this posted successfully to the post bin url, but didn't automatically open index.html.  So I changed it to get the json...I think and named it index.php.
I'll run it immediately from the console..not sure this is going to work.  I might have to read about hooks in git some more.
